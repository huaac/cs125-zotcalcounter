Motivation: 
Many people struggle to begin their fitness journey because they donâ€™t know where to start. Even those who have started struggle to remain consistent. It can be difficult to understand what to do based on your own goals. College is around when people start to work out, now that they have access to a gym on campus. Here at UCI, we have great facilities but not much to guide people. We believe that creating an application to provide recommended exercises to the user would help keep them motivated and consistent, regardless of how experienced they are

State of the Art / Current solution:
We want to solve this by creating an app that recommends exercises catered to the user. This is accomplished through understanding what the user needs (by asking questions like what muscles they want to focus on) as well as looking at their exercise history to see what types of exercises they might like. By having the user check in every time they do a work out, we will be able to collect data (exercise name, how long they exercised, how much they liked they exercise), which we will then use to recommend better exercises. By creating a customized recommendation, the user is more likely to be motivated to work out. The exercises that we recommend will be organized by muscle group, and it will provide information such as difficulty level, required equipment, and instructions.
